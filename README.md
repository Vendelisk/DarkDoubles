# Dark Doubles
A two month sprint I worked through to try my hand at Metroid-Vania.  The design documents are included with the source and it was genuinely fun to make but I don't have plans to continue developement on it.  If you've found your way here, give it a shot!  It's not gonna change the world but it's a pretty fun short story.
